/**
 * Plugin icon resolution — CLIENT-SAFE. Ported from cloud-portal unchanged.
 *
 * A `portal.nav/platform` or `portal.resource/platform` extension declares
 * `icon` as a *name*, never code (see the manifest contract) so navigation and
 * the Resources list render without executing plugin code and a broken plugin
 * can never take down the shell. The host resolves that name to a lucide
 * component here.
 *
 * lucide-react ships no clean dynamic-icon subpath (its `DynamicIcon`
 * lazy-imports one chunk per icon, which is the wrong shape for something
 * that must render immediately), so v1 uses a curated map of common
 * infrastructure/service icons keyed by lucide's canonical kebab-case name,
 * with a puzzle-piece fallback for anything unmapped. Add names here as
 * plugins need them; keep the whole map in this one file.
