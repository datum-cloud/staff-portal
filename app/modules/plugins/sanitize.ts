 * the identical sanitized shape from one definition — no drift.
 *
 * Deliberately omits `assets.caBundle` and `assets.baseURL`: plugin origins
 * are never exposed to the browser. The client loads assets through
 * `/api/plugins/<slug>/…`; any plugin API calls go through staff-portal's
 * existing `/api/internal/*` proxy.
